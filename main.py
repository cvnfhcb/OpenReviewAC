"""
OpenReview AC Workflow Automation
==================================

Automates the Area Chair (AC) workflow for OpenReview conferences by:
- Retrieving papers assigned to you as an Area Chair
- Extracting review scores, comments, and discussion activity
- Writing all data to a Google Sheet for easy tracking and management

Usage:
    1. Set up environment variables in .env file:
       - OPENREVIEW_USERNAME: Your OpenReview email
       - OPENREVIEW_PASSWORD: Your OpenReview password
       - GSHEET_CREDENTIALS_PATH: Path to your Google Sheets service account JSON key

    2. Configure settings in config.py (CONFERENCE_NAME, etc.)

    3. Run the script:
       python main.py

Supported Conferences:
    - ICLR2026
    - NeurIPS2025
    - ICCV2025
    - ICML2025

For detailed setup instructions, see README.md

    OpenReviewACPapers handles operations for Area Chair-specific paper management

        Retrieve and process all papers assigned to you as an Area Chair.

        This method performs a comprehensive retrieval and analysis of all papers
        assigned to the authenticated user in their Area Chair role for the
        configured conference.

        The method performs the following steps:
        1. Verifies that you are an Area Chair for the conference
        2. Identifies all papers assigned to you (using conference-specific logic)
        3. For each assigned paper:
           - Retrieves all reviews and extracts initial and final scores
           - Counts different types of notes (rebuttals, comments, etc.)
           - Checks withdrawal status
           - Generates OpenReview URL

        Returns:
            List[dict]: List of dictionaries, one per assigned paper, containing:
                - paper_title: Title of the submission
                - paper_number: OpenReview paper number
                - paper_url: Direct link to paper on OpenReview
                - withdrawn: Boolean indicating if paper is withdrawn
                - num_reviewers: Number of assigned reviewers
                - avg_score: Average initial review score
                - reviewerN_score: Individual reviewer initial scores (1-5)
                - avg_final_score: Average final review score (if available)
                - reviewerN_final_score: Individual reviewer final scores (1-5)
                - *_count: Counts of various note types (reviews, rebuttals, comments, etc.)
                - reviewer_participation: Number of participating reviewers

        Raises:
            Warning: If user is not an Area Chair for the configured conference

        Note:
            Different conferences use different assignment methods:
            - ICLR: Uses specific AC assignment groups (Area_Chair_{code})
            - NeurIPS/ICCV: Uses paper.readers to determine assignments
            The method automatically detects and uses the appropriate method.
