# OpenReview AC Workflow Automation

Automate your Area Chair (AC) workflow for OpenReview conferences. This tool retrieves all papers assigned to you as an AC, extracts review scores and discussion activity, and organizes everything in a Google Sheet for easy tracking and management.

## Features

- **Automatic Paper Retrieval**: Fetches all papers assigned to you as an Area Chair
- **Review Tracking**: Extracts review scores (initial and final ratings)
- **Discussion Monitoring**: Counts rebuttals, comments, and AC letters
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Writes all data to a structured spreadsheet
- **Multi-Conference Support**: Works with ICLR, NeurIPS, ICCV, and ICML
- **Incremental Updates**: Can update existing sheets without clearing previous data

## Supported Conferences

- ICLR 2026
- NeurIPS 2025
- ICCV 2025
- ICML 2025

Additional conferences can be easily added by extending the `CONFERENCE_INFO` dictionary (see [Adding New Conferences](#adding-new-conferences)).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- OpenReview account with Area Chair role
- Google Cloud project with Sheets API enabled
- Google service account credentials

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OpenReviewAC.git
   cd OpenReviewAC
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Setup

### 1. OpenReview Credentials

Create a `.env` file in the project root (use `.env.example` as a template):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and add your OpenReview credentials:

```
OPENREVIEW_USERNAME=your_email@example.com
OPENREVIEW_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**Note**: 
- The script automatically loads credentials from the `.env` file using `python-dotenv`
- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
- The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

### 2. Google Sheets API Setup

To write data to Google Sheets, you need a service account:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one

2. **Enable the Google Sheets API**:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

3. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "Service Account"
   - Fill in the service account details and create
   - Click on the created service account
   - Go to the "Keys" tab
   - Click "Add Key" → "Create new key" → "JSON"
   - Download the JSON key file

4. **Save the credentials**:
   - Move the downloaded JSON file to the project directory
   - Rename it to something memorable (e.g., `gsheet-credentials.json`)
   - Update `GSHEET_JSON` in `main_ac_tasks.py` to match the filename

5. **Share your Google Sheet**:
   - Open the JSON credentials file
   - Find the `client_email` field (looks like `xxx@xxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
   - Create a new Google Sheet or open an existing one
   - Click "Share" and add the service account email as an editor

### 3. Configuration

Edit `main_ac_tasks.py` and update the configuration constants:

```python
# Choose your conference
CONFERENCE_NAME = "ICLR2026"  # Options: "ICLR2026", "NeurIPS2025", "ICCV2025", "ICML2025"

# Path to your Google Sheets service account key file
GSHEET_JSON = "gsheet-credentials.json"

# Name of your Google Sheet
GSHEET_TITLE = f"{CONFERENCE_NAME} AC DB"

# Worksheet name (tab)
GSHEET_SHEET = "Sheet1"

# Set to True to clear the sheet and start fresh, False to update existing data
INITIALIZE_SHEET = False
```

See `config_example.py` for more details.

## Usage

Once configured, simply run:

```bash
python main_ac_tasks.py
```

The script will:
1. Connect to OpenReview using your credentials
2. Retrieve all papers assigned to you as an Area Chair
3. Extract review scores, comments, rebuttals, and other activity
4. Write/update the data in your Google Sheet

### Output Data

The Google Sheet will contain the following columns for each paper:

- **paper_title**: Title of the submission
- **paper_number**: OpenReview paper number
- **paper_url**: Direct link to the paper on OpenReview
- **num_reviewers**: Number of assigned reviewers
- **avg_score**: Average initial review score
- **reviewer1_score** through **reviewer5_score**: Individual reviewer scores
- **avg_final_score**: Average final review score (if applicable)
- **reviewer1_final_score** through **reviewer5_final_score**: Final scores
- **review_count**: Number of official reviews
- **rebuttal_count**: Number of author rebuttals
- **discussion_comment_count**: Number of reviewer-author discussion comments
- **other_comment_count**: Number of other comments
- **ac_letter_author_count**: Number of AC letters from authors
- **ac_letter_ac_count**: Number of AC letters from ACs
- **withdrawn**: Whether the paper has been withdrawn

## Adding New Conferences

To add support for a new conference:

1. Add an entry to the `CONFERENCE_INFO` dictionary in `main_ac_tasks.py`:

```python
"YourConf2026": dict(
    # Required: Conference ID from OpenReview
    CONFERENCE_ID = 'yourconf.org/2026/Conference',
    
    # Required: Function to extract paper number
    PAPER_NUMBER_EXTRACTOR = lambda paper: paper.number,
    
    # Optional: Function to extract rating from review
    RATING_EXTRACTOR = lambda review: (
        int(review.content["rating"]['value'])
        if "rating" in review.content and "value" in review.content["rating"]
        else None
    ),
    
    # Required: Dictionary of note type extractors
    NOTE_EXTRACTORS = {
        'review': lambda note: any(
            invitation.endswith('Official_Review') for invitation in note.invitations
        ),
        'rebuttal': lambda note: any(
            invitation.endswith('Rebuttal') for invitation in note.invitations
        ),
        # Add more note types as needed
    }
)
```

2. Update `CONFERENCE_NAME` to match your new conference key

3. Test thoroughly with a small number of papers first

## Troubleshooting

### "You are not an area chair for this conference"
- Verify that `CONFERENCE_NAME` matches the conference where you're an AC
- Check that you're logged in with the correct OpenReview account
- Ensure your AC assignment is active in OpenReview

### "Permission denied" errors with Google Sheets
- Verify that the service account email has editor access to the Google Sheet
- Check that the service account JSON file path is correct
- Ensure the Google Sheets API is enabled in your Google Cloud project

### "Module not found" errors
- Make sure you've activated the virtual environment
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again

### Script runs but no data appears in Google Sheet
- Check the sheet name in `GSHEET_TITLE` matches exactly
- Verify the worksheet tab name in `GSHEET_SHEET` is correct
- Look at the console output for error messages
